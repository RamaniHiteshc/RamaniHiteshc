### Hi there 👋

<!--
**RamaniHiteshc/RamaniHiteshc** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started
-->
👨🏻‍💻  I’m primarily an Software Engineer.
👨🏻‍🔬  I like experimenting with tech. This has led me into many interesting domains such as writing firmware code for custom wearable hardware and building mobile SDKs for enabling DSP on Android and iOS .
🤗  I love contributing to the open-source ecosystem and the community by giving talks, writing blog posts, co-authoring/reviewing books, building Android libraries, etc. whenever I can.
🌱  I’m currently (trying to) learn Rust lang , React Native , Flutter 
💬  I dabble in Android, Kotlin, Java, Rust, UI/UX and spend most of my time automating my life via literally living inside the terminal 🤷🏻‍♂️
📝  I often blog about random tips/tricks and (mostly) Android [at] Crushing C.O.D.E
⚡️  Fun fact about me: I love playing 🕹 retro games and survive on ☕️ instead of energy drinks 🙇🏻‍♂️  Possibly this is why I also talk a lot 🤔
📫  Reach me [at] ramanihiteshc.blogspot.com
☕️  You can support me in maintaining my open source work by buying me a coffee or sponsoring me on GitHub 🤗
